### Standard file formats

#### Beacon-style JSON

With the maturation of the Beacon v2 protocol and associated data schemas,
the default delivery of JSON encoded data follows the standard Beacon response
format where the main data is contained in the `response.results` array.

#### Columnar data files

##### `.pgxsg` segment data

##### `.pgxmatrix` data matrices

### Downloads using the GUI
