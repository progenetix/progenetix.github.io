## {{ page.title }}

The current implementation of the Progenetix APIs uses 2 URL endpoints:

* `progenetix.org/beacon/`
  - documented at [Beacon paths](/doc/beacon/paths.html)
  - powered by the [bycon](http://github.com/progenetix/bycon/) project
  - target for further development
* `progenetix.org/services/`
  - also powered by the [bycon](http://github.com/progenetix/bycon/) project
  - additional, Progenetix specific functionality

#### Legacy API

* `progenetix.org/api/` has been deprecated
  - based on the original Perl libraries
  - stepwise deprecation in favour of `services`
