## NCIt coding of tumor samples

* based on [NCIt neoplasm core](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/About_Core.html)
* first implementation of NCIt concepts mapping in January 2017, for a subset of arrayMap samples
* currently working on the [ICDOntoologies](https://github.com/progenetix/ICDOntologies) mapping project
