### Progenetix.net: an online repository for molecular cytogenetic aberration data.
#### Baudis M, Cleary ML.

**Abstract** UNLABELLED: Through sequencing projects and, more recently, array-based expression analysis experiments, a wealth of genetic data has become accessible via online resources. In contrast, few of the (molecular-) cytogenetic aberration data collected in the last decades are available in a format suitable for data mining procedures. www.progenetix.net is a new online repository for previously published chromosomal aberration data, allowing the addition of band-specific information about chromosomal imbalances to oncologic data analysis efforts.
